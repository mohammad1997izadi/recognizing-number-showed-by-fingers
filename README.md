Recognizing Numbers Shown by Fingers
This project uses deep learning with PyTorch to recognize numbers displayed by fingers using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Three types of models were developed and compared: an overfitted model, an underfitted model, and an optimally trained model. Various learning rates and batch sizes were experimented with, and the results have been documented.

The goal is to demonstrate the effects of different model configurations and hyperparameters on performance. The project still has some challenges, and I welcome any contributions or suggestions to help improve it.
